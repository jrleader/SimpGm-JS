# SimpGm-JS
This is my first simple application created using JavaScript. 

Idea of the application is mostly based on a school assignment that I was not assigned. 
I will try to keep updating stuff as I learn more about JavaScript and other frontend technologies from time to time, 
__suggestions about how to make the project better are highly welcome!__
